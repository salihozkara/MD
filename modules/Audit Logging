An audit log entry consists of critical data about each client request:

* URL, Browser, IP address, client name,
* The user,
* HTTP method, HTTP return status code,
* Success/failure, exception details if available,
* Request execution duration,
* The entities have been created, deleted or updated in this request (with changed properties).

Audit log system can be controlled  by class, method, entity and property levels. The screenshots(screenshots from audit logging ui module) below show some details of a simple audit log:
